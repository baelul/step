            Hello! My name is Baelul Haile. I am a sophomore at the 
            New York University's Tandon School of Engineering in Brooklyn, 
            New York. I am majoring in Computer Science, and plan on minoring in
            both Cybersecurity and Integrated Digital Media. I am currently a 
            STEP intern based in Mountain View, California, but due to COVID-19, 
            I am working from home in Laurel, Maryland. 
            <br>
            I have worked on a couple projects in the past, but the ones I have
            and will do during the STEP program will be the first official (professional)
            projects I will have done. To learn more about the projects I've done,
