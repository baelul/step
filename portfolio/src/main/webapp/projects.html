      <h3>Past Projects</h3>
      I haven't done many projects in my past, as the STEP internship is my first
      real, professional opportunity for experience in the CS world. However, 
      I have a few smaller projects that I've worked on in and out of school.
      <ol>
        <li>The summer after my senior year I participated in Google CSSI. During 
        the 3 week program, my group and I created Local, a website that aims 
        to bring together travelers who wish to experience the world by placing
        them directly into a localâ€™s shoes, navigating an unfamiliar area with 
        someone who knows it best. If you want to check it out,

        </li>
        <li>During my freshman year, in an engineering based entrepreneurship
        course, I worked in a group of 3 to make a prototype of an app
        called Grupo. The aim of the app was to make decision 
        making in big groups easier and more efficient, with it's main 
        function being an anonymous polling system.
