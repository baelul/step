            <h3>Past Projects</h3>
                I haven't done many projects in my past, as the STEP internship is my first
            real, professional opportunity for experience in the CS world. However, 
            I have a few smaller projects that I've worked on in and out of school.
            <ol>
                    <li>The summer after my senior year I participated in Google CSSI. During 
                        the 3 week program, my group and I created Local, a website that aims 
                        to bring together travelers who wish to experience the world by placing
                        them directly into a localâ€™s shoes, navigating an unfamiliar area with 
                        someone who knows it best.
                    </li>
                    <li>During my freshman year, in an engineering based entrepreneurship
                        course, I worked in a group of 3 to make a prototype of an app
                        called Grupo. The aim of the app was to make decision 
                        making in big groups easier and more efficient, with it's main 
                        function being an anonymous polling system.
