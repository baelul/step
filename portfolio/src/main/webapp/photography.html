      <h3>Photography</h3>
      While I wouldn't consider myself a professional photographer 
      (or anything near it, for that matter), I do enjoy taking photos.
      I love taking pictures of nature, especially very vibrant things,
      like flowers or the sunrise. I also love taking pictures of 
      family/friend gatherings, because I like to document fun and
      memorable experiences. For example, my Instagram account is filled 
      with places I've been and group events (+ the occasional selfie).
