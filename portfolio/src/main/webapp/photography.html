                <h3>Photography</h3>
                While I wouldn't consider myself a professional photographer 
                (or anything near it, for that matter), I do enjoy taking photos.
                I love taking pictures of nature, especially very vibrant things,
                like flowers or the sunrise. I also love taking pictures of 
                family/friend gatherings, because I like to document fun and
                memorable experiences. For example, my Instagram account is filled 
                with places I've been and group events (+ the occasional selfie).

                Here are some photos I've taken:
