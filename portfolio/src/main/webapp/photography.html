            Hello! My name is Baelul Haile. I am a sophomore at the 
            New York University's Tandon School of Engineering in Brooklyn, 
            New York. I am majoring in Computer Science, and plan on minoring in
            both Cybersecurity and Integrated Digital Media. I am currently a 
            STEP intern based in Mountain View, California, but due to COVID-19, 
            I am working from home in Laurel, Maryland. 
            <br>
            I have worked on a couple projects in the past, but the ones I have
            and will do during the STEP program will be the first official (professional)
            projects I will have done. To learn more about the projects I've done,

                    <h3>Photography</h3>
                    While I wouldn't consider myself a professional photographer 
                    (or anything near it, for that matter), I do enjoy taking photos.
                    I love taking pictures of nature, especially very vibrant things,
                    like flowers or the sunrise. I also love taking pictures of 
                    family/friend gatherings, because I like to document fun and
                    memorable experiences. For example, my Instagram account is filled 
                    with places I've been and group events (+ the occasional selfie).

                    Here are some photos I've taken:
