            Hello! My name is Baelul Haile. I am a sophomore at the 
            New York University's Tandon School of Engineering in Brooklyn, 
            New York. I am majoring in Computer Science, and plan on minoring in
            both Cybersecurity and Integrated Digital Media. I am currently a 
            STEP intern based in Mountain View, California, but due to COVID-19, 
            I am working from home in Laurel, Maryland. 
            <br>
            I have worked on a couple projects in the past, but the ones I have
            and will do during the STEP program will be the first official (professional)
            projects I will have done. To learn more about the projects I've done,

                <h3>Fun Facts!</h3>
                As an extra introduction, I have included some random facts about
                myself!
                <ol>
                    <li>I love anime, and have become indulging in them 
                        for the past year, especially during quarantine. My 
                        favorite anime are Banana Fish, Haikyuu!, My Hero Academia
                        and Naruto. </li> 
                    <li>I have recently gotten into art, specifically sketching
                        and painting. Pinterest has become my new favorite app.
                        and I spend a majority of my time making boards for art inspiration.</li> 
                    <li>It's my dream to travel the world. My first goal is to travel
                        to prominent places in the US, like California (where I would've been
                        this summer!). Eventually, though, I want to travel to France and Japan.</li> 
                    <li>Music inspires me. I love music, especially bedroom pop and indie. I also
                        sometimes like listening to classical music because it makes me feel like
                        I'm living in a dramatic movie (lol).</li> 
                </ol>
