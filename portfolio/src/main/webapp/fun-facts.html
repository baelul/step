        <h3>Fun Facts!</h3>
        As an extra introduction, I have included some random facts about
        myself!
        <ol>
          <li>I love watching anime, and have been a fan of them 
          for the past year. With all the free time I had during quarantine, I've watched
          tons of animes, my favorites being Banana Fish, Haikyuu!, My Hero Academia 
          and Naruto.</li>
          <p class="center"><img src="/images/hahaanime.gif" alt="Anime vs Social Life"</p> 
          <li>I have recently gotten into art, specifically sketching
          and painting. Pinterest has become my new favorite app.
          and I spend a majority of my time making boards for art inspiration.</li> 
          <li>It's my dream to travel the world. My first goal is to travel
          to prominent places in the US, like California (where I would've been
          this summer!). Eventually, though, I want to travel to France and Japan.
            <ul>One thing that's on my bucket list is to go to a lantern festival (like in the
            movie Tangled!). The ones I've seen are held in Southeast Asia, specifically Japan
            and Thailand!</ul></li>

          <li>Music inspires me. I love music, especially bedroom pop and indie. I also
          sometimes like listening to classical music because it makes me feel like
          I'm living in a dramatic movie (lol). My favorite artists include Billie Eilish,
          Frank Ocean, Daniel Caesar, and Rex Orange County.</li> 
        </ol>
