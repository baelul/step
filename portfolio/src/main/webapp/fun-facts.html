                <h3>Fun Facts!</h3>
                As an extra introduction, I have included some random facts about
                myself!
                <ol>
                    <li>I love anime, and have become indulging in them 
                        for the past year, especially during quarantine. My 
                        favorite anime are Banana Fish, Haikyuu!, My Hero Academia
                        and Naruto. </li> 
                    <li>I have recently gotten into art, specifically sketching
                        and painting. Pinterest has become my new favorite app.
                        and I spend a majority of my time making boards for art inspiration.</li> 
                    <li>It's my dream to travel the world. My first goal is to travel
                        to prominent places in the US, like California (where I would've been
                        this summer!). Eventually, though, I want to travel to France and Japan.</li> 
                    <li>Music inspires me. I love music, especially bedroom pop and indie. I also
                        sometimes like listening to classical music because it makes me feel like
                        I'm living in a dramatic movie (lol).</li> 
                </ol>
