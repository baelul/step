            <h3>My Hidden Talent</h3>
            A "hidden talent" may be a stretch, but I would say that mine
            would be singing! I'm not very open about it (if you ask me to 
            sing for you, don't expect much), but I do enjoy casually singing
            songs with my friends. I'm not a performer or anything; I'm simply
            basing this on my friends' remarks :)
