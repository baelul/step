      <p>
          Hello! My name is Baelul Haile. I am a sophomore at the 
          New York University's Tandon School of Engineering in Brooklyn, 
          New York. I am currently a STEP intern based in Mountain View, 
          California, but due to COVID-19, I am working from home in 
          Laurel, Maryland.

          Some fun facts about me:
          <ol>
              <li>I love anime, and have become indulging in them 
                  for the past year, especially during quarantine. My 
                  favorite anime are Banana Fish, Haikyuu!, My Hero Academia
                  and Naruto. </li> 
              <li>I have recently gotten into art, specifically sketching
                  and painting. Pinterest has become my new favorite app.
                  and I spend a majority of my time making boards for art inspiration.</li> 
              <li>It's my dream to travel the world. My first goal is to travel
                  to prominent places in the US, like California (where I would've been
                  this summer!). Eventually, though, I want to travel to France and Japan.</li> 
              <li>Music inspires me. I love music, especially chill "Bedroom Pop". I also
                  sometimes like listening to classical music because it makes me feel like
                  I'm living in a dramatic movie (lol).</li> 
          </ol>
          <br>
          <h3>Projects</h3>
          I haven't done many projects in my past, as the STEP internship is my first
          real, professional experience in the CS world. However, I have a few smaller projects
          that I've worked on in and out of school.
          <ol>
                <li>The summer after my senior year I participated in Google CSSI. During 
                    the 3 week program, my group and I created Local, a website that aims 
                    to bring together travelers who wish to experience the world by placing
                    them directly into a localâ€™s shoes, navigating an unfamiliar area with 
                    someone who knows it best.
                </li>
                <li>During my freshman year, in an engineering based entrepreneurship
                    course, I worked in a group of 3 to make a prototype of an app
                    called Grupo. The aim of the app was to make decision 
                    making in big groups easier and more efficient, with it's main 
                    function being an anonymous polling system.
