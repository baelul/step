          Hello! My name is Baelul Haile. I am a sophomore at the 
          New York University's Tandon School of Engineering in Brooklyn, 
          New York. I am currently a STEP intern based in Mountain View, 
          California, but due to COVID-19, I am working from home in 
          Laurel, Maryland.

          Some fun facts about me:
          <ol>
              <li>I love anime, and have become indulging in them 
                  for the past year, especially during quarantine. My 
                  favorite anime are Banana Fish, Haikyuu!, My Hero Academia
                  and Naruto. </li> 
              <li>I have recently gotten into art, specifically sketching
                  and painting. Pinterest has become my new favorite app.
                  and I spend a majority of my time making boards for art inspiration.</li> 
              <li>It's my dream to travel the world. My first goal is to travel
                  to prominent places in the US, like California (where I would've been
                  this summer!). Eventually, though, I want to travel to France and Japan.</li> 
              <li>Music inspires me. I love music, especially chill "Bedroom Pop". I also
                  sometimes like listening to classical music because it makes me feel like
                  I'm living in a dramatic movie (lol).</li> 
          </ol>
